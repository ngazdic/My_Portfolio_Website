My Portfolio Site
Structured code that's easy to understand and easily scalable

CSS Grid & Flexbox
I created fluid layouts throughout the page with a mixture of Grid and Flexbox. The app is fully responsive on multiple screen widths.

JavaScript
I created functions to animate the navbar or the section titles, depending on the scroll position on the page.
